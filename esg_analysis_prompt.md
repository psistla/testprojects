4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Check alignment with relevant frameworks (GRI, SASB, TCFD, etc.)

### Step 4: Actionable Insights
1. **Key Findings**: Summarize the most significant insights in order of importance
2. **Performance Gaps**: Identify areas where performance lags expectations or benchmarks
3. **Improvement Opportunities**: Suggest specific, measurable improvements
4. **Strategic Recommendations**: Provide strategic advice for ESG program enhancement
